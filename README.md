# SUPERMARKET DATA ANALYSIS TO OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE
# 

A supermarket chain owned by Company XYZ across the country. Sales information was collected from each of the three major branches located across the country for a period of three months. The purpose of this assessment was to assist the company in understanding its sales trends and determining its growth, as supermarket competition is expected to increase.

Datasets are contained in three different locations: Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt. There is an identical set of attribute information in each of the data files.
